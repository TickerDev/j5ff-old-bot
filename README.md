# J5ff Bot!
Ah yes, the **J5ff Bot**, highly seeked after, highly enticipated.

You need to have NodeJS downloaded, https://nodejs.org/en
Once you download, install all the required packages using 
```bash
$  npm install
```
Once this is done, go and edit the `config.json` file with all the necessary information.

After all said and done, run the following command to run it:
```bash
$  node .
```

Good luck, I don't know if the bot even runs
